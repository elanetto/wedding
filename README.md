# Wedding site
Before our wedding, we used this site to give practical information to our guests. And after the wedding, we now use this site as a place for our guests to find and download the photos from our wedding. This is a personal project.

## Tools and technology
This project was built with HTML and CSS, and it was first designed and planned in Figma.

This Wedding site was made by me, Anette Therese Lindberg, during the fall of 2023. It has since been updated in june of 2024.

## What was the purpose of this project?
Before the wedding, we used the webpage as an easy way to update our wedding guests on practical infromation for the upcomming wedding.

After the wedding, we wanted an easy and simple way to share our proffeccional wedding photographs with everyone who attended.
We ended up sending out Thank You-cards, inclueding the link to the webpage, and the password to get to the photos.

One of the reasons we wanted it to be this easy to see the photos, is because I haven been in a couple of weddings but never gotten to see the proffecial photos afterwards.
I know, from experience, how much I would have loved to go though the photos as a wedding guest. 


## How was the process?
Simple and to the point! I wanted the webpage to be simple, and to incluede two elements:
- a button to get to the photos
- a YouTube video

I started in Figma, and wrote the code in HTML and CSS within a few hours.

## Learning Points & self assesment
The more you know about programming, the easier it gets to build what you want - quickly and easily.
I could have put more thought into the design of the footer - b ut it is a practical one with practical links and information.
