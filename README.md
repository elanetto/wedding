# Wedding site
Before our wedding, we used this site to give practical information to our guests. And after the wedding, we now use this site as a place for our guests to find and download the photos from our wedding. This is a personal project.

This Wedding site was made by me, Anette Therese Lindberg, during the fall of 2023. It has since been updated in june of 2024.
